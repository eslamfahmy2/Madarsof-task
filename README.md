# Madarsof User Data App

This is an Android application built using the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture. The app allows users to input their name, age, job title, and gender, and then saves these details to a local database. The app uses modern Android development tools and libraries such as Jetpack Compose for UI, Hilt for dependency injection, Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous programming, and the Room database for data persistence.

# Features

*  User input form to capture name, age, job title, and gender.
*  Save user details to a local Room database.
*  Display saved user details on a separate screen.
*  Clean architecture with MVI pattern.
*  Dependency injection using Hilt.
*  Modern UI built with Jetpack Compose.
*  Asynchronous operations using Kotlin coroutines.


# Architecture
The app follows clean architecture principles and the MVI pattern. It is divided into the following layers:

* UI Layer: Composables and ViewModels using Jetpack Compose.
* Domain Layer: Business logic, use cases, and domain models.
* Data Layer: Repositories and data sources using Room database.

# Dependencies

* Kotlin: Programming language.
* Jetpack Compose: For building declarative UIs.
* Hilt: Dependency injection library.
* Room: Database library for local data persistence.
* Coroutines: For asynchronous programming.
* JUnit: For unit testing.
* Mockito: For mocking dependencies in tests.
* Compose Testing: For UI tests.
